A CT scan can be performed with or without contrast dye. \nThe contrast material helps your doctor analyze important vessels and structures. \nIt also allows them to identify abnormalities that cannot be seen without the dye.','Shoulder','CT',103,7),(7,'A skull X-ray is an imaging test doctors use to examine the bones of the skull, \nincluding the facial bones, the nose, and the sinuses.avg an easy, quick, \nand effective method that has been used for decades to help doctors view the area that houses your most vital organ â€” your brain.','Brain','Xray',101,1),(8,'A standard X-ray is a simple test in which an X-ray beam \n(a form of electromagnetic radiation) is passed through the knee to create a two-dimensional picture of the bones that form the joint. \nYour doctor can use X-rays to view bone spurs. \nBony overgrowths at the joint are a sign of osteoarthritis.','Knee','Xray',102,1),(9,'A standard X-ray is a simple test in which an X-ray beam (a form of electromagnetic radiation) \nis passed through the shoulder to create a two-dimensional picture of the bones that form the joint. \nYour doctor can use X-rays to view: joint space.','Shoulder','Xray',103,1);
